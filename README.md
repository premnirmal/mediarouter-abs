# MediaRouter

## Changes to the original Mediarouter
- Changed references from AppCompat to the ABS version
- Added onMute listener
- Changed resource that shows 'no cast available' icon to a blank (gray) drawable because when using ABS, the `onDeviceAvailable(..)` callback is not called.

## Dependencies
- Android support-v4
- ActionBarSherlock

## Build Note
In Eclipse, make sure you add the three jellybean* directories to the build path. (Right-click > Build Path > Use as Source Folder)
